# Constitution for "My First AI Humanoid"

## Core Principles

### 1. Target Audience

This book is for beginners and intermediate learners with an interest in AI and robotics. The content should be accessible, engaging, and easy to understand, with clear explanations for all concepts.

### 2. Focus on Hands-on Learning

The book will emphasize hands-on learning through practical projects and real-world examples. The primary goal is to guide readers in building their own physical AI humanoids.

### 3. Tech Stack

The book will be published as a Docusaurus website. This allows for interactive examples, easy navigation, and a modern reading experience. All content should be created with Docusaurus features in mind.

### 4. Code and Schematics

All code examples and hardware schematics must be clear, well-documented, and tested. They should be presented in a way that is easy for readers to follow and replicate.

### 5. Visuals

The book will make extensive use of diagrams, illustrations, and photographs to explain complex topics and show the building process.

### 6. Tone

The tone of the book should be encouraging, inspiring, and friendly. It should foster a sense of curiosity and empower readers to start their own AI humanoid projects.

### 7. Integration of Advanced AI

The book will introduce cutting-edge AI concepts, including Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models and Large Language Models (LLMs), to bridge the gap between theoretical AI and practical robotics. These topics will be presented with a focus on practical application, demonstrating how they can serve as the "brain" for a humanoid robot, enabling natural language understanding and cognitive planning.

## Governance

This constitution is the guiding document for the project. Any changes must be discussed and agreed upon by the core team.
